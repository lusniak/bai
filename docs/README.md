## BAI

BAI is an application that suggests You which Google photo to choose for a wallpaper depending on where you are at the moment.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
